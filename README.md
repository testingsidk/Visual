How to use visual you may ask?
                  (Download Chromium https://www.chromium.org/Home)
 After that open visual.exe (visual may be flagged as a virus due to it being made in python i think)
 After that choose the amount of accounts you wanna create (these are bot accounts with random users)
 After being created you should find the account's user name and password in accounts.txt they should look like this username:password
 And thats all you need to know.
